### makeUndoableHandler & invertHandlers - Example

This example is equivalent to the previous examples, except that we we use the utility **makeUndoableHandler** to convert "setCount" to the do/redo and undo handlers for "add". We then use **invertHandlers** to convert these to the handlers for "subtract".
