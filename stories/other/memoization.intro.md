### Memoization - Example

In this example the **handlers** object is memoized before passing it to **useUndoableEffects**, so that the **undoables** (the undoable functions returned by the hook) are not recreated on every render. In the actions panel ðŸ‘‰ (or the browser console) the message 'UNDOABLES CHANGED' should only be logged when opening this example, and not when interacting with it.
