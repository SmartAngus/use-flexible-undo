### Switch to branch - Example

In this example we get the list of branches from the **history** state and sort them so that the last modified branch is on top. We use the sorted list to generate the options for a branch select box. When the user selects an option the **switchToBranch** function is called with the id of the corresponding branch as first argument and the option 'HEAD_OF_BRANCH' as second argument.
